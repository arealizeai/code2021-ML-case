# Code 2021 Machine learning notebook

This repo contains a introduction notebook on how one can create a simple linear regression machine learning model in jupyter notebook. The notebook has however used a older version of the dataset than what is provided to the teams, so it should rather be used as a introduction instead of a solution. The teams can change and modify the notebook as they will. The teams can even use this notebook as a building stone for your solution.


## Jupyter notebook
To run this application on needs jupyther notebook. After installation, navigate to the folder where the repo was cloned, and run:

```
jupyter notebook
```
In the notebook there will be explanation of how to use pip and install all the needed packages.

## Questions
If the teams have any questions, everything from the notebook to the weather, come and ask the mentors on the hackathon. We are happy to help ðŸ˜„
